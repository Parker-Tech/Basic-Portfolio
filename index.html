                Hello, I am Justin Parker and welcome to my portfolio. This is a test run for 
                the future but eventually it will turn out great. Although I am interested in computers
                as a whole, I am contemplating studying Physics as my major. I have to do a lot of work
                to catch up to my peers but once I get through this course I feel like I'll be on the 
                right track. 
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                I am looking forward to doing well in this class. With the help of my peers and the
                support staff I think I can achieve a lot.
            </p>
